      <p>
<p>I am originally from <b>Seoul, South Korea</b>, immigrated to the <b>United States</b> in 2011 and became a U.S. citizen in 2018.
<p>Because of my status being an international student status to a naturalized citizen, I have an empathetic view to understanding diverse groups of the population.
<p>Iâ€™ve been developing <b>aspirations</b> of designing an ideal work environment for those individuals who suffer from cultural shock, homesickness, psychological trauma triggered by different cultural experiences that are unexpected.
<p><b>Industrial/Organizational Psychology (I/O Psychology)</b> will be a tool for me to carry out my goals. I am learning and developing knowledge in the field to apply in future work. I work as <b>an undergraduate research assistant</b> at the Work Stress and Recovery lab at Virginia Tech.
<p>I am studying <b>Psychology and Professional & Technical Writing (PTW)</b> The knowledge of PTW major leads me to be familiar with the professional writing skills for scholars. I am also working as <b>a content design assistant</b> at the Virginia Tech Libraries.
<p> I am working hard as <b>a third-year undergraduate student</b> to be a doctorate student of I/O Psychology for <b> Fall 2020.</b> </p>
